tar 
-x: Stands for extract, this will unpack all the contents of the file.
-f: Stands for file. This uses the argument after the options as the path of the archive we want to extract.
-z: This makes sure we run the file through gzip, another archive tool. The extention tar.gz hints that it is processed through gzip.
-C: This changes the directory before extracting to the path supplied as an argument. This means the contents will be extracted in this folder.
-t: Will only list the contents of the archive to the screen. It will not unpack anything.
